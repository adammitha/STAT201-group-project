Student 2.

* Report is very well researched – notable number of sources used and lots of context is given to support topic of research.
* Using data from 2017-2019 to avoid any outliers in 2019 is smart and justified well. Any assumptions that are necessary are clearly stated and explained why they are made.
* Code is self-contained in the file as well as notes throughout the code explaining what lines are doing.
* I personally think it is unnecessary to explain things such as what “tidy” data is or how you will calculate SE of proportion – in normal circumstances it is understandable if this were to be read by the general public but in the context of the course and the knowledge everyone knows it would be more efficient to just leave it out.
* Spelling and grammar convention are generally well written however there are some issues with run-on sentences separated by many commas. Ex. In first sentence of Reflection and third paragraph in Background.
* Data illustrations help set the context and scene for project very effectively. We (being the reader) can easily see different parts of the data such as amount of crime per year based on neighborhood and etc. This helps support your hypothesis and initial analysis well.

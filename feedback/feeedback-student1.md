* The criteria and reasons used to choose the three neighborhoods was mentioned but not shown how it was derived. I think calculations involved in comparing the median wealth of the different neighborhoods should be included in the document.
* The analysis was well done! The project explained all the different steps and why those steps were necessary and how they fit into the project. The use of proportion makes sense in investigating the increase in specific neighborhoods relative to the increase of all the neighborhoods.
* I also think the waffle plot was a good idea; however, since we are comparing more than 5 types (8 types) of crimes it was a bit confusing to compare for the different years. Let me give a suggestion. Since you are interested in the proportion of crimes and not specifically the types of crimes that happened, I think treating all types of crimes as just one thing is a good idea. So basically weâ€™ll have a proportion of crime (adding all the numbers and treating it as one single crime) for different years. This way, you can use one histogram with four bars representing proportion for the four different years.
* The grammar was good! Easy to read and understand.
